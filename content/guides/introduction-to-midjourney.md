# Midjourney: Revolutionising AI-Generated Artwork

## Introduction
Midjourney is a cutting-edge company that is changing the way we think about AI-generated artwork. With a focus on user-friendly design and value-focused innovation, Midjourney is making it easier than ever for anyone to create stunning pieces of art using nothing but text-based prompts.

## About Midjourney
Founded by a team of experienced professionals with a passion for AI technology, Midjourney is dedicated to pushing the boundaries of what is possible with AI-generated artwork. The company is advised by a group of industry experts and executives who bring a wealth of knowledge and experience to the table.

## Midjourney’s Platform
One of the most unique things about Midjourney is that it runs entirely within the Discord platform. This means that users can create AI-generated artwork using nothing but text-based prompts, all within the familiar and user-friendly environment of Discord.

While this approach has many benefits, such as ease-of-use and accessibility, there are also some limitations to consider. For example, Discord may not be the ideal platform for all users, and there may be some limitations in terms of the types of artwork that can be created.

It’s also worth noting that Midjourney has recently cancelled its free access after several viral deepfakes were made using the software1. This means that users must now pay to use Midjourney’s services.

## Competitors
Midjourney is not without its competitors. There are several other companies out there that are also working on AI-generated artwork, each with their own unique features and capabilities.

However, what sets Midjourney apart from its competitors is its focus on user-friendly design and value-focused innovation. By making it easy for anyone to create stunning pieces of art using nothing but text-based prompts, Midjourney is well-positioned to become a leader in this exciting new industry.
